Chocolates Java Project

A child is located in the center of a 2 dimensional array. The 2 dimensional array
has a number of chocolates in each index. If there is no center, child will be placed
at the highest number of chocolates near the center. The program has the child eat
chocolates from where it started. Then child moves to either left, right, up, or down
to the next highest number of chocolates and eats it. This iterates until there are
no more moves to take where the child can eat more chocolates. Once the child stops
eating chocolates, the chocolate pieces eaten will be summed and displayed at the end.
