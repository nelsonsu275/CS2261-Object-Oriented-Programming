Stopwatch Project

Program simulates a stopwatch for measuring time.
Program has get methods for startClock and endClock.
A constructor initializes startClock with current time.
A method starts the timer by resetting the startClock to current time.
A method stops the timer by setting endClock to current time.
A method returns elapsed time in milliseconds.

Using the created methods above, the program measures the execution time of
sorting 10000 random numbers in an array using bubble sort algorithm.
