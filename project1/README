Project 1 Java Credit Card Number Validation

Program prompts user for a credit card number to see if it is valid.
A long integer is accepted.
Credit card number must be:
- Between 13-16 characters.
- Start with 4, 5, 37, or 6
Program performs Luhn check or Mod 10 check algorithm to validate number:
Every second digit from right to left is doubled. If any doubled digit become two-digit, add the two digits together.
Add all digits together.
All all digits in odd places from right to left.
Add the two sums together.
If this number is divisible by 10, the number is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.
