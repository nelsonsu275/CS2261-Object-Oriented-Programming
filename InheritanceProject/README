Inheritance Project

This program creates an abstract class called Machine with 3 subclasses 
(Printer, Scanner, and Smartphone) to inherit the fields of the Machine 
superclass. Each machine will have setters and getters for the machine's 
name, price, weight, and description. The main function will create an array 
of 10 Machine objects and set the details of each machine using setters.
Afterwards, each machine and their information is displayed using getters.
